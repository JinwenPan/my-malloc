# My Malloc
In this project, a set of memory allocation functions is implemented:

1. `void *malloc(size_t size)`
2. `void free(void *ptr)`
3. `void *calloc(size_t nitems, size_t size)`
4. `void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)`

## Usage
After `make`, a shared library called `libmymalloc.so` will be generated. The library should be preloaded in existing applications to perform the custom memory management operations above.

## Features

1. The payload pointers returned by `malloc` is 8-bytes aligned.
2. The implemented allocation strategy can reuse the already freed blocks and split or merge the free blocks, when necessary.
3. The allocator is thread-safe and be able to scale as the number of application threads that perform memory operations increases.
